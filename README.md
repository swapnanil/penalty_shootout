penalty_shootout
================

My first software which I wrote 2 years back, a football-penalty shootout game.

I had made this game as an academic project in class 12.

This software was written in Turbo C++. The code uses the <i>gotoxy(x, y)</i> function to move the print cursor across
the screen. The <i>gotoxy(x, y)</i> fucntion works only in 32 bit architechtures. Also, the included header files are not available for newer (after Turbo C++) compilers of C++.

I will try to find an alternative for <i>gotoxy(x, y)</i>. Maybe you can help me with it. :)
